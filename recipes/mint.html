    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I just love everything that has to do with mint. Ice cream, cakes, lemonade, tea, 
        even cough drops taste better if they are mint flavoured. What is rather unfortunate 
        is that my current partner absolutely despises mint. Catch me yapping about a peppermint
        essential oil's good smell only to realise he would rather be anywhere than near that 
        oil bottle. But it's not like one man is going to stop me from consuming this fresh 
        delicacy every chance I get. 
    </p>
    <p>Never actually tried this recipe so proceed with caution. But it's got mint in it so why 
        would it be so bad, after all? Worse you could get is a sore throat or some bowel movements. 
        Or an allergic reaction. Please do not get an allergic reaction. 
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon peppermint extract</li>
        <li>half teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>green food coloring, optional</li>
        <li>1 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir milk, cream, sugar, vanilla, peppermint extract, and salt together in a large bowl 
            until the sugar has dissolved. Mix in green food coloring.</li>
        <li>Pour mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
        <li>Add chocolate chips about 10 minutes into the freezing. Continue churning until ice cream has thickened, about 20 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, about 2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Oh they are using an ice cream machine. How sweet of them. Now what ever will us poor peasants do who don't
        have an ice cream machine. I guess we will never know.
