    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Who doesn't love elderberry syrup? We people of the Balkans sure do.
        I have yet to meet a household, especially a rural one, where the kids
        do not know or love elderberry. Some even eat it fried. Can you imagine
        what fried flowers could taste like?
    </p>
    <p>Enough chit-chat. I'm also supposed to let you know about the actual properties
        of this syrup. Well, it's sweet. It's best served with water, some prefer 
        sparkling over regular. Some serve it in lemonade. It also has some health 
        benefits that I know absolutely nothing about but I'm sure you can Google it.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh elderberries</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>3 whole cloves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1 cup honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, elderberries, ginger, cinnamon stick, and cloves in 
            a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low 
            and simmer for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Mash berries with a potato mixture to release juices. Strain the 
            mixture through a fine sieve, retaining juice and discarding pulp, 
            cinnamon stick, and cloves. Let cool for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in honey until thoroughly combined.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Man, I just realised this is elderberry syrup and not elderflower syrup. 
        I meant to drool over elderflower syrup, not whatever this is. Anyways. 
        If you're lucky enough to know about elderflower syrup you've probably 
        also got a grandma, mom, aunt or someone around you could ask for the actual recipe.
