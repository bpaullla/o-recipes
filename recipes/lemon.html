    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>If life gives you lemons, you gotta learn to love them. Unless you're allergic 
        to them. God forbid you consume them if that is the case for you. You just gotta 
        ask life nicely and politely to leave you alone with all the lemon foolery. Of 
        course it will not leave you alone. But you learn to deal with it sooner or later.
    </p>
    <p>Anyways, I love lemonade. I also prefer lemon icing to all sorts of fancy chocolate 
        desserts. So why not love lemon cake as well? You would think this is normal cake 
        with lemon filling but it's actually not. It's got lemon in the cake batter hehe. You'll see.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 and half cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>half teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>half teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>2 and half cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 and half cups unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon extract</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also add glaze but I never did so I will not copy that part of the recipe, sorry.
        Also add some lemon zest to the batter. Trust me.
